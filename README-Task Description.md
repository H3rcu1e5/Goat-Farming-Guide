The aim of this project is to design and implement a mobile and web based Goat Farming Guide system. This system will be designed in Python using the Django library, developed through rapid prototyping methodologies, and will be used to manage the versions of the prototypes from the initial to the final mobile and web based systems. The systems amongst their many functionalities will provide a knowledge base for the sharing of necessary information on goat raring to farmers new and old, as well as information on solutions to various challenges present in goat rearing. This system will provide information sharing to its users on the following topics:
